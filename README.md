## Why did you... ⁉️

**... use Rust? 🦀**

- It's fast
- It's cool
- The [US Government](https://arc.net/l/quote/xfwrzrvl) says you should use Rust 🦅
- I would use a garbage collector if I could, but performance 😔
- Actual type system

**... use Linux? 🐧**

- How else were we supposed to get Rust 🦀 working?
- ev3dev has done the hard work for me
- ~~so that I can say I use Arch, btw~~ for legal reasons, that was a joke, ev3dev is a Debian distro
- I like penguins

**... not just use Scratch?**

> um actually, it's Lego's Scratch-like language called [insert name here, I have no idea what its called] 🤓☝️

If you have ever used a programming language in a text editor with actual keybindings you will understand how painful moving blocks around can be.
